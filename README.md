<h1>Azure Crash Course</h1>

This is a tutorial of learning the basics of Microsoft Azure with Resource Groups and Storage Accounts.

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

  - Windows 10

<h2>Technology Used</h2>

  - Microsoft Azure

<h2>Steps</h2>

First, go to https://portal.azure.com/#home
Next, create a resource group. There are multiple ways of finding resource groups. The easiest way for me is searching it up in the search bar at the top of the page.

Click on "Create" or "Create resource group."

Name your resource group and click "Review + create"

Click on "Create." The resource group has been successfully created.

Next, search for and continue to "Storage Accounts." Now click "Create storage account"

Now, using the resource group previously created, name the Storage Account and click "Review". Now click "Create". The Storage Account is successfully created.

Now search for and go to Resource Groups. Once the storage group is deployed it should show in the resource group "Overview" tab. Click on the storage account created.

Create a word document to upload to the storage account and save a message inside.

Click on the "Upload" button. Then either drag the word document into the box or upload it via browsing the Windows Explorer.

 Now create a new container in which the file will be held. Now upload the file.

Next, right click on the file and click "View/edit." Now, edit the file by writing in a new message in the word document and click save.

Finally, click "download" The document will be a new document that has been edited within Azure.

Remember to DELETE THE RESOURCE GROUP. Go to the resource group created and click "Delete resource group."

Copy the name of the resource group and paste it in the text box at the bottom. Click on Delete in the pop-up box.
